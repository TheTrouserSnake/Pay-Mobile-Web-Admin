### If you choose to run it on your own server, visit the Pay Mobile Server Repo

## This is the official Nodejs server code that this app is running on <a href="https://github.com/adedayoniyi/Pay-Mobile-Server">Pay Mobile Server</a>

## Important

### After you are done with configuring the server, dont forget to update the uri in the global_constants.dart file

1. Locate lib\core\utils\global_constants.dart and edit line 6 using the server URL you generated or created. Changes will apply globally. Check Below:

```dart
6. const String uri = "https://transfer-dayo-niyi.onrender.com";
```

To

```dart
6. const String uri = "Your server URL";
```
